[Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) is my first experience with a JavaScript testing framework.

Really easy to implement. For instance, to test this simple function `sum()`, we create an additional test file named `sum.test.js`:

```JavaScript
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Then, in our `package.json` we add this script command:

```JavaScript
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
},
```
