[Pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/) is the most famous Python Data Analysis library.

For my internal tests, I use a dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices): the historical data on avocado prices.

I will run my tests from the [Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) notebook: a web-based computing environment.

### Loading a CSV file in a Pandas DataFrame:
```Python
import pandas as pd

# df is a Pandas DataFrame structure
df = df.read_csv('avocado.csv')
```

We can now extract from this data structure only the lines related to one specific country.

### Filtering:
```Python
albany_df = pf [ pf["region"] == "Albany"]
```

The new dataframe will only contains records related to "Albany".

To be continued...
