As the usual practice, I'm starting the new year with a bunch of resolutions. Of course many of them will remain unachieved. But one of those was to start a personal blog - Which is done if you read these lines.

Why a blog ? Well, as a software developer and a never ending knowledge seeker, this is the best way to structure my thought in order maybe to improve my communication skills. This is also a perfect place to record my learnings and technical discoveries.

Since two years now, I dedicate some of my (limited) free time to develop my skills through various personal projects. The challenge being to find a balance between my job, my hobbies and, more important, my duties as a father.
