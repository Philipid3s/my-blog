[Kontra](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) is a lightweight JavaScript library.

The micro-library has been initially created for the [Js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/) game jam.

My project is to create a tiny rpg game - mainly inspired by old school Zelda or the great rebirth of Isaac. Definitly no way I can create that in less than 13k.

I will use [Tiled Map Editor](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) for editing the tiles map.
