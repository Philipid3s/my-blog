[Kontra](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) is a lightweight JavaScript library.

This micro-library has been initially created for the [Js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/) game jam.

My purpose is to create a tiny rpg game - inspired by old school Zelda or the great rebirth of Isaac. Definitly no way I can create that with less than 13k. But honnestly, the purpose of this work is mainly to practice my JavaScript and discover the possibilities of gaming in JS within a web browser.

I will use [Tiled Map Editor](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) for editing the tiles map.
