Welcome to my developer diary. I will use this space to log my discoveries and learning milestones.

My name is Julien Regnault. I'm a Singapore based full stack developer consultant. New tech enthusiast, passionate and working in the CTRM industry for more than ten years, I'm very familiar with the process of building software on technical and functional levels.
